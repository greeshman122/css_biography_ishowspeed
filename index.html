            INFLUENCER CAREER <br>
            
            2016 to 2021: Beginnings
            Watkins created his YouTube account in 2016, uploading gameplay videos occasionally.Around December 2017, Watkinsbegan livestreaming and uploading videos of games such as NBA 2K and occasionally Fortnite, but only managed to average
            two viewers. <br><br>
            
            2021 to 2022: Initial popularity, Talking Ben videos, and controversies
            He became prominent in 2021 after his fanbase began posting clips on TikTok of his often-violent behavior during live streams towards games, players, and his camera, which gained popularity and became memes. His outbursts have resulted in bans from the streaming platform Twitch and the video game Valorant. Kotaku described Watkins as "one of the biggest and fastest-rising streamers" on YouTube. A game that has greatly contributed to his growth in popularity is Talking
            Ben. Watkins' videos on Talking Ben the Dog were credited for bringing the mobile app newfound popularity, with it
            becoming the best-selling game on the App Store over a decade after its initial release. <br><br>
            
            In April 2021, Watkins's YouTube channel reached 100,000 subscribers.After two months, his channel reached 1 million subscribers in June 2021. <br><br>
            
            In December 2021, Watkins took part in a Twitch "e-dating" livestream show hosted by Adin Ross. The exchange between Watkins and another participant, Ash Kash, escalated to what was widely interpreted as a rape threat. Watkins was the first contestant to be eliminated, and shortly after the game had ended, he quickly rejoined the Discord call. He
            started sexually harassing Kash, slurring her repeatedly. Watkins was then kicked out of the call, with Ross apologizing to Kash for his behavior. Watkins was later banned from Twitch.[11][14] According to a Twitter post by him, Watkins was
            banned for "sexual coercion or intimidation." <br><br>
            
            In April 2022, a clip of Watkins playing Valorant on a live stream surfaced. In the clip, he tells a female player to,
            "Get off the fucking game and do your husband's dishes." This resulted in one of the game's producers, Sara
            Dadafshar, permanently banning Watkins from Valorant and all other Riot Games titles. YouTube global head of
            gaming creators, Lester Chen, replied to the clip, saying he was "on it." Watkins soon apologized for his behavior,
            acknowledged that it was "wrong", and claimed that he was receiving racist comments from other players that day. <br><br>
            
            On American Independence Day, July 4, 2022, Watkins set off a Pikachu firework inside his bedroom, almost burning it
            down, which attracted media attention. He also hit 10 million subscribers on YouTube in July 2022. <br><br>
            
            In August 2022, he was swatted while livestreaming on YouTube. Officers handcuffed Watkins, and his cameraman was forced
            to end the stream. Watkins claimed that he had been placed in jail and that Adin Ross had to bail him out, allowing
            him to return to streaming on August 11. <br><br>
            
            2022 to present: Travel, shift to soccer-based content and WWE
            In September 2022, Watkins played in the Sidemen Charity Match. A clip of him went viral in which he became
            frustrated at English referee Mark Clattenburg for disallowing his goal to be offside, and in response, Watkins
            proceeded to whip him with the shirt he removed while celebrating, which resulted in him receiving a yellow card. <br><br>
            
            In November 2022, American rapper and singer Lil Nas X appeared on Watkins' stream. In the same month, Sky Sports
            announced that they would stop featuring him on their platform after the emergence of past misogynist and derogatory
            comments made by Watkins. The platform also removed all content featuring Watkins. <br><br>
            
            In December 2022, he won the Streamy Award in the "Breakout Streamer" category during the 12th Streamy Awards.
            Throughout November and December 2022, he visited various soccer stadiums to try and watch Cristiano Ronaldo play live.
            He traveled to Old Trafford, Craven Cottage, and various other stadiums in Qatar, though Ronaldo was on the bench during
            those games, up until Portugal's loss to Morocco. <br><br>
            
            During the round of 16 match between Portugal and Switzerland, in December 2022, Watkins garnered controversy for his
            behavior toward a Chinese spectator of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, which was interpreted by many as racist. During
            a live stream, he approached a man wearing an Argentina jersey to question him. Visibly confused, the man specified that
            he did not speak English, which prompted Watkins to start repeatedly hurling "Konnichiwa", a Japanese greeting, and
            start uttering sounds reminiscent of Cantonese and Mandarin Chinese. When a clip of the live stream started circulating
            online, he uploaded an apology video to his Twitter account. <br><br>
            
            In January 2023, Watkins had a portrait of Cristiano Ronaldo tattooed on his arm. In February 2023, Watkins uploaded
            a short video on one of his secondary channels stating he was behind Thumb Media Affiliate and Cardigan, two copyright
            companies that had either been claiming ad revenue or striking videos from channels that had been using clips from his
            streams. Other content creators also discovered Adin Ross, one of his associates, was also behind the labels. Following
            this short, Watkins faced significant backlash from his community. <br><br>
            
            In May 2023, Watkins announced he had signed an exclusive streaming deal with the video-sharing platform Rumble, in
            collaboration with Kai Cenat. A month later, after many attempts, Watkins met Cristiano Ronaldo in the carpark of
            Estádio da Luz in Lisbon after Portugal's 3-0 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina. <br><br>
            
            In July 2023, he was rushed to a hospital while in Tokyo, Japan, after having a sinus infection and a stinging pain in
            his head which he described as a cluster headache. <br><br>
            
            In August 2023, he hit 20 million subscribers on his YouTube account. On August 16, 2023, during a livestream,
            Watkins jumped up from his seat due to being jumpscared while playing Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach and
            accidentally flashed his penis to a live viewership of 25,000 people. He subsequently ended and deleted the
            livestream. Viewers uploaded the clip of the incident onto social media, and the term "IShowMeat", in reference to the
            slang word meat, meaning penis, began trending on Reddit and X (Twitter). YouTube declined to strike his channel
            or ban him from the platform due to the accidental nature of the incident. <br><br>
            
            In October 2023, Watkins met and collaborated with Indian singer Daler Mehndi during his visit to India.On October
            11, 2023, Twitch unbanned Watkins's account after nearly two years. <br><br>
            
            On May 29, 2024, Watkins attended the annual Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake in Gloucestershire, England, during
            which he suffered a leg injury, which he claimed required hospitalization. <br><br>
            
            On June 2, 2024, he reached 25 million subscribers on his YouTube account in a 15-minute-long livestream entitled "25
            million.......". On June 20, 2024, he met Albanian prime minister Edi Rama during his live stream in
            Albania. On July 3, 2024, Watkins visited Norway, where he found himself trapped in a souvenir shop due to a
            large crowd. While gesturing to them from a second-story window, he jumped and injured his ankle, but believed he broke
            it. Unable to walk, he was escorted out by one of his bodyguards, in which he was attacked by the crowd, with some of
            them pulling him by the hair and one jumping on top of his car. He was later rushed to the hospital to have his
            ankle treated. During the incident, the Norwegian Police Service refused to assist Watkins until he ended his
            stream. He vowed never to return to Norway, but returned later that month. <br><br>
            
            On August 3, 2024, Watkins performed a live-streamed stunt where he jumped over two speeding luxury cars—a Lamborghini
            and a McLaren—in Miami to prove his athleticism and silence skeptics who had previously doubted the authenticity of his
            car jump videos. The stream was then deleted on August 5, 2024, due to the stream itself violating YouTube's Terms of
            Service. A few days later, the live stream itself was restored. <br><br>
            
            WWE appearances

            and RKOed onto the commentators' table.
